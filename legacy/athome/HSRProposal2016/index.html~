<h3> Description of the approach and information on scientific achievements</h3>

Profs. Stone, Thomaz, and Niekum aim to combine their expertise in
reinforcement learning, human-robot interaction, and learning from
demonstration towards a full solution to the RoboCup@Home challenge.
We propose to bring together postdocs, graduate students, and
undergraduate students from each of our groups to enable the HSR robot
to interact seemlessly with people in the environment, learn behaviors
ranging from object manipulation to robust environmental perception,
to high-level task sequencing.  Our development efforts will be
situated within our ongoing <a
href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~larg/bwi_web/">Building-Wide
Intelligence project</a>, which already includes several
human-interactive robots, and which has the long-term objective of
enabling a team of robots to achieve long-term autonomy within the
rich socially interactive environment of the UT Austin Computer
Science building.  The HSR robot will thus be embedded within a
multi-robot system of heterogeneous robots while its novel software is
under development at UT Austin (though of course during the
competition it will act fully independently).  

<p> 

Profs. Thomaz and Niekum have performed much of their past research in
home-like environments and have an existing shared lab space set up as
an apartment with a living room, dining room, and kitchen.  This lab
space is in the same building as the Building-Wide Intelligence, and
will therefore allow us to easily develop and test the robot in both
an open, fully interactive setting and a more controlled home-like
setting.

<p>
We expect the HSR robot to enhance our overall system's breach of
capabilities and thus quickly play an important role in novel research
on topics ranging from activity recognition, to robust perception, to
learned planning and navigation, to general human-robot interaction.
Throughout our development, we will continue our strong tradition of
releasing well-documented, self-contained behavior modules for
components of autonomous robots that can be used by other research
groups to enhance their own research.

<h3> Software</h3>

During our participation in the RoboCup@Home SPL, we are fully
committed to continuing our strong tradition of contributing open
source code to the community.

<menu>
<li> Our <a
href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~pstone/Papers/bib2html/b2hd-LNAI16-MacAlpine2.html">
UT Austin Villa RoboCup 3D Simulation Base Code Release</a> won 2nd
prize in the 2016 Harting Open Source Competition.  It is the basis for our team that has won 5 of the 6 competitions. 

<li> Our <a
href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~pstone/Papers/bib2html/b2hd-LNAI13-Barrett.html">Soccer
SPL source code release</a>, which formed the core of our 2012
SPL championship, has been widely used in the league.

<li> Our <a href="https://github.com/utexas-bwi/">BWI code
repository</a> provides an open source suite of ROS packages, fully
integrated into an architecture for service robots that operate in
dynamic and unstructured human-inhabited environments.  It has been
built on top of the Robot Operating System (ROS) middleware
framework. This software architecture provides a hierarchical layered
approach for controlling autonomous robots, where layers in the
hierarchy provide different granularities of control.  Specifically,
this architecture includes navigation software that allows a mobile
robot to move autonomous inside a building, while being able to switch
2D navigational maps when using the elevator to move to a different
floor. A symbolic navigation module is built on top of this autonomous
navigation module which allows the robot to navigate to prespecified
doors, rooms, and objects in the environment.  From a high-level
perspective, the software architecture includes planning and reasoning
modules that allow the robot to execute high level tasks, such as
delivering an object from one part of the building to another, using a
complex sequence of symbolic actions.

<li> Our <a
href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~pstone/Papers/bib2html/b2hd-RoboCup13-hester.html">TEXPLORE
code</a> provides an open-source package for reinforcement learning on
real robots.

<li> Our <a href="http://wiki.ros.org/ar_track_alvar">ar_track_alvar</a> ROS package has become a community
standard for tag-based perception.

<li> Our ROS implementation of <a href="http://wiki.ros.org/dmp">Dynamic
Movement Primitives</a> has become a popular tool for learning from demonstration. 

<li> We have made research code available for:

<li> <a href="http://wiki.ros.org/changepoint">Bayesian changepoint
detection</a>,
