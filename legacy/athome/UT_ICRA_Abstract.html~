<h2>Abstract for ICRA 2008 Video</h2>

<br>

This video shows a Segway robot from the University of
Texas at Austin competing in the finals of the 2007 Robocup
@Home competition, which featured home assistant robots
performing various challenging tasks. This demonstration
combines a few tasks which will likely be performed by a
future home assistant robot. The robot learns a human's
appearance, follows the human with his back turned,
distinguishes the human from a similarly clothed stranger,
and adapts when it notices that the human has changed his
clothing. For this task, we introduce a novel
two-classifier architecture, using the subject?s face as a
primary identifying characteristic and his shirt as a
secondary characteristic
