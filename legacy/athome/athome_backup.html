<p>RoboCup @Home is an international research initiative that aims to 
"to foster the development of useful robotic applications that can 
assist humans in everyday life" (from the Robocup @Home Rulebook). 
In 2006, robots in a living room and kitchen environment had to 
complete three specified tasks: navigate to a commanded location, 
manipulate one of three chosen objects, and follow a human around 
the room. Additionally, there was one free form task, during which 
teams showed off their most impressive technical achievements. These 
tasks have been revamped and three new tasks have been added for 
2007. To complete these new tasks, the robot must be able to search 
for and locate previously seen objects, differentiate and 
qualitatively describe humans, and copy a human's block movement in 
a game-like setting.</p>

<p>The members of UT Austin Villa's @Home team welcome the exciting
challenge of this new league. UT Austin Villa hopes to continue its
long history of success in RoboCup competitions and conferences.</p>

<p>Our home assistant robot is built from a Segway RMP base. The Segway
senses its world with a laser range finder, a stereo camera, and a 
single camera. A tablet PC, attached to the top of the platform,
evaluates sense data and outputs motion commands.</p>

<p>The @Home team is Peter Stone, William B. Knox, Juhyun Lee, 
Youngin Shin, and Mohan Sridharan.</p>
