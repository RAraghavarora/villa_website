</div>The team is just getting back from the 2005 US Open where we placed
third.  While we lost our semifinal match 1-0 to Penn, we played an
exhibition match against the eventual first place team, CMU, and won
2-1.  In official play, we outscored our opponents 24-1.  With a little
bit of luck we could have wound up in 2nd or even 1st.  We're coming
home with a lot of ideas for improvement though, so we're looking
forward to Robocup 2005 in Osaka!

best of the competition.  We are now attending the RoboCup Symposium
where we are presenting a poster and two papers.</dd>
